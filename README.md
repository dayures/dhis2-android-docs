Android related documentation: app, SDK, implementation, other technical stuff

This repository contains all the Android related documentation pointed by the [https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-docs-builder](DHIS2 Docs Builder). Until Jan '22 the documentation was part of the application source code but was decided to move to this stand alone repository.

Information about how to edit this documentation can be found in the internal documentation [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U9FivwOlPO1QZrL6uQmfmZlmTO3B5J2xhggFQ8tWOuA/edit#](Documenting the Android App).
